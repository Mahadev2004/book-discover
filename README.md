# Book Recommendation System

A Flask-based web application that provides book recommendations through popularity-based filtering and book discovery features. This system allows users to explore popular books and search for specific titles with intelligent matching.

## Features

- **Popular Books Display**: Shows top-rated books with cover images, authors, ratings, and vote counts
- **Book Discovery**: Search functionality that finds books containing user input with case-insensitive matching
- **Rating-Based Recommendations**: Displays top 5 related books sorted by average rating
- **Responsive Web Interface**: Clean HTML templates for user interaction

## Project Structure

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   https://github.com/Mahadev2004/book-discover/tree/main
 
3. **Install required dependencies**

pip install flask pandas numpy pickle


3. **Prepare the data**
- Ensure you have the following CSV files in the project directory:
  - `books.csv`
  - `users.csv` 
  - `ratings.csv`

- Run the data preprocessing script:

python data_prep.py


## Usage

1. **Start the Flask application**

python app.py


2. **Access the application**
- Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
- The homepage displays popular books with their details
- Click on "Discover" to search for specific books

3. **Book Discovery**
- Enter a book title or keyword in the search box
- The system will return up to 5 related books sorted by rating
- Results include book title, author, and cover image

## Data Processing

The `data_prep.py` script performs the following operations:

- **Data Loading**: Reads books, users, and ratings from CSV files
- **Data Cleaning**: Converts book titles to lowercase for consistent matching
- **Aggregation**: Calculates number of ratings and average ratings per book
- **Serialization**: Saves processed data as pickle files for faster loading

## Dependencies

- **Flask**: Web framework for the application
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy**: Numerical computing support
- **Pickle**: Data serialization

## API Endpoints

- `GET /`: Homepage displaying popular books
- `GET /discover`: Book discovery page
- `POST /discover_books`: Processes book search requests

## Data Sources

The system expects three CSV files:
- `books.csv`: Book information (ISBN, title, author, publication year, publisher, image URLs)
- `users.csv`: User demographics
- `ratings.csv`: User ratings for books

## Features in Detail

### Popular Books Section
- Displays books sorted by rating and popularity
- Shows book covers, titles, authors, ratings, and vote counts
- Data is pre-processed for optimal performance

### Book Discovery
- Case-insensitive search functionality
- Partial title matching
- Returns top 5 results based on average rating
- Handles "not found" cases gracefully

## Development

To extend the project:

1. **Add Collaborative Filtering**: The Jupyter notebook contains analysis that can be extended for user-based recommendations
2. **Enhance Search**: Add filters for author, genre, or publication year
3. **User Accounts**: Implement user registration and personalized recommendations
4. **Rating System**: Allow users to rate books and update recommendations

**Note**: Ensure all CSV data files are present before running the application. The system requires pre-processed pickle files generated by `data_prep.py` to function properly.
